# hackin-breakin-risc-v

This repository is a hacking playground for my RISC-V exploration. 

We will learn about the many elements in an assembly language program. Among these elements, we have directives, labels, mnemonics, operands, immediates, instructions, and pseudo instructions.
Major focus on:

    Describe the RISC-V assembly language syntax and features.
    Identify the many elements of a RISC-V assembly program, like directives, labels, mnemonics, and operands.
    Identify the pseudoinstructions in a RISC-V assembly program.
    Explain how Control and Status Registers are managed in the RISC-V assembly code.
    Use immediate values properly in a RISC-V assembly program.
